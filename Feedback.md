# Task board

## Sprint 1

All the user stories in task board should not be a whole sentence, instead, it should be more **specific individual tasks** so that can be assigned easily.

## Sprint 2

With stepping forward, we should move all the remaining unfinished tasks from sprint 1 to sprint 2, leaving them **waiting and unfinished** in the third column in sprint 1.

# Log in/Log out

Although it's not required, but since we are doing a airport crud system, it's better for us to develop our log in/ log out pages due to various user needs.

# User database

We can set up a **user database**, or not, to distinguish the users when they are logging in to our home page. If not setting up the database, a **criteria** should be set inside the back end.

# CRUD operations

There is no need for separate pages for each CRUD operations. We can do all the functions or several functions on the same page, just not on the same screen, as we want.
